A comparison of airlines such as indigo and emirate and creating a mix with my own taste

1. Emirates feels luxurious, whereas IndiGo is utilitarian and focused on speed.
2. IndiGo is simpler; Emirates offers more up-front data, which may overwhelm some users.
3. IndiGo's step-by-step input feels more focused. Emirates is comprehensive but dense
4. Emirates wins with inline and more informative calendar
5. Emirates provides clearer differentiation between classes.
6. Emirates prioritizes clarity; IndiGo goes for speed and simplicity.
7. Emirates has a more complete, editable summary. IndiGoâ€™s is functional but limited.
8. IndiGo is more mobile-friendly. Emirates prioritizes feature richness.

Now I combined these positive ui into a new airline app/website
